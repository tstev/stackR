## stackR

_A collection of my questions destined for StackOverflow_

When dealing with a problem in R or others (mainly R though) I usually resort to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (SO) for help. Not before trying to solve it  on my own. Usually, I break the problem down into a _simplified_, _smaller_ and _simulated_ problem. Then I attempt to google my way to a solution. If after trying and I still don't have a solution I usually compose a question with reproducible example for SO. In addition I try to show my previous attempts and ultimately my desired results.

The reason for turning this into a repository was to centralize my stackoverflow questions between my work and my own projects. I figured it could serve as a nice reference point without the mess involved by emailing scripts to myself and such.
